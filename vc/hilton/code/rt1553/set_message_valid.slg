%%%  Simplified H4 on reading formula in, to give:
     %%%  H4:  lru_name__first <= src
%%%  Simplified C5 on reading formula in, to give:
     %%%  C5:  lru_name__first <= src
***  Proved C3:  subaddress_idx >= bus__lru_subaddress_index__first
     using hypothesis H2.
***  Proved C4:  subaddress_idx <= bus__lru_subaddress_index__last
     using hypothesis H3.
***  Proved C5:  lru_name__first <= src
     using hypothesis H4.
***  Proved C6:  src <= lru_name__last
     using hypothesis H5.
-S-  Applied substitution rule set_message__rules(14).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of bus__lru_index__first by:
          1.
<S>  New C1:  element(lru_names, [src]) >= 1
-S-  Applied substitution rule set_message__rules(15).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of bus__lru_index__last by:
          12.
<S>  New C2:  element(lru_names, [src]) <= 12
-S-  Applied substitution rule set_message__rules(9).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of 
          bus__lru_subaddress_index__first by:
          1.
<S>  New H2:  subaddress_idx >= 1
-S-  Applied substitution rule set_message__rules(10).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of 
          bus__lru_subaddress_index__last by:
          8.
<S>  New H3:  subaddress_idx <= 8
-S-  Applied substitution rule set_message__rules(20).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of lru_name__first by:
          barometer.
<S>  New H4:  barometer <= src
-S-  Applied substitution rule set_message__rules(21).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of lru_name__last by:
          warhead.
<S>  New H5:  src <= warhead
---  Eliminated hypothesis H1 (true-hypothesis).
***  Proved C1:  element(lru_names, [src]) >= 1
     using hypotheses H4 & H5.
***  Proved C2:  element(lru_names, [src]) <= 12
     using hypotheses H4 & H5.
***  PROVED VC.
