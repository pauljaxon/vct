procedure if_destruct.Init






@@@@@@@@@@  VC: procedure_init_1.  @@@@@@@@@@
%%%  Simplified C1 on reading formula in, to give:
     %%%  C1:  stage__first <= destruct_cfg__inactive
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(114).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of stage__first by:
          destruct_cfg__inactive.
<S>  New C1:  true
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(115).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of stage__last by:
          destruct_cfg__detonated.
<S>  New C2:  true
***  Proved C1:  true
***  Proved C2:  true
***  PROVED VC.


@@@@@@@@@@  VC: procedure_init_2.  @@@@@@@@@@
%%%  Simplified H2 on reading formula in, to give:
     %%%  H2:  stage__first <= destruct_cfg__inactive
%%%  Simplified C1 on reading formula in, to give:
     %%%  C1:  ibit__phase__first <= ibit__off
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(56).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of ibit__phase__first by:
          ibit__off.
<S>  New C1:  true
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(57).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of ibit__phase__last by:
          ibit__timeout.

%%%  Simplified C1 on reading formula in, to give:
     %%%  C1:  bc1553__lru_name__first <= bus_id
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(13).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of bc1553__lru_name__first 
          by:
          bc1553__barometer.
<S>  New C1:  bc1553__barometer <= bus_id
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(1).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of bus_id by:
          bc1553__destruct.
<S>  New C2:  bc1553__destruct <= bc1553__lru_name__last
<S>  New C1:  true
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(14).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of bc1553__lru_name__last 
          by:
          bc1553__warhead.
<S>  New C2:  true
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(8).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of 
          bus__lru_subaddress_index__first by:
          1.
<S>  New C3:  true
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(9).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of
