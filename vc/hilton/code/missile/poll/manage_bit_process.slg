%%%  Simplified H2 on reading formula in, to give:
     %%%  H2:  for_all(i___1 : bc1553__lru_name, bc1553__lru_name__first <=

          fld_bit_phase(element(fld_components(state), [i___1])) <= 
          ibit__phase__last)
%%%  Simplified H3 on reading formula in, to give:
     %%%  H3:  phase_stage__first <= fld_phase(state)
%%%  Simplified C1 on reading formula in, to give:
     %%%  C1:  phase_stage__first <= boost
-S-  Applied substitution rule manage_bit_p_rules(78).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of phase_stage__first by:
          off.
<S>  New H3:  off <= fld_phase(state)
<S>  New C1:  true
-S-  Applied substitution rule manage_bit_p_rules(79).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of phase_stage__last by:
          shutdown.
<S>  New H4:  fld_phase(state) <= shutdown
<S>  New C2:  true
***  Proved C1:  true
