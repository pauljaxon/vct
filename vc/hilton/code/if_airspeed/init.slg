-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(2).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of 
          measuretypes__meter_per_sec__first by:
          - 5000.
<S>  New C1:  true
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(3).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of 
          measuretypes__meter_per_sec__last by:
          5000.
<S>  New C2:  true
***  Proved C1:  true

%%%  Simplified C1 on reading formula in, to give:
     %%%  C1:  ibit__phase__first <= ibit__off
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(60).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of ibit__phase__first by:
          ibit__off.
<S>  New C1:  true
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(61).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of ibit__phase__last by:
