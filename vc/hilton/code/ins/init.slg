@@@@@@@@@@  VC: procedure_init_1.  @@@@@@@@@@
%%%  Simplified C1 on reading formula in, to give:
     %%%  C1:  rt1553__lru_name__first <= bus_id
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(28).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of rt1553__lru_name__first 
          by:
          rt1553__barometer.
<S>  New C1:  rt1553__barometer <= bus_id
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(1).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of bus_id by:
          rt1553__ins.
<S>  New C2:  rt1553__ins <= rt1553__lru_name__last
<S>  New C1:  true
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(29).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of rt1553__lru_name__last 
          by:
          rt1553__warhead.
<S>  New C2:  true
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(23).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of 
          bus__lru_subaddress_index__first by:
          1.
<S>  New C3:  true
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(24).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of 
          bus__lru_subaddress_index__last by:
          8.

-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(13).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of

          0.
<S>  New C2:  0 <= clock__millisecond__last
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(14).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of clock__millisecond__last
